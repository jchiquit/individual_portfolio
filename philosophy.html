        <h3>Educational Philosophy</h3>
        <p>I believe that the purpose of education in society is to receive an equal education around the world. Whether it is providing the same resources, like textbooks or pencils, or having enough teachers and support in a school, like special education teachers. In order to improve our society everyone must have the same opportunities to achieve their goals.<br><br>
        What, specifically, is the role of the teacher in the classroom? The role of a teacher is to use classroom instruction and presentations to help students learn and apply concepts in math, English, and science.
        <br><br>
        The role of a teacher is to support and guide their students with their academic career. Every teacher has their own specialty and their own way of teaching, but every teacher’s ultimate goal is to help their students succeed. Overall, this is done by teaching subject areas like math and reading, but it is also more than that. It is our job to help them be good people once they are out in the real world.

        <br><br>
        Every child learns differently. One student might be a visual learner and other students could learn by taking notes. Hence, every teacher must include differentiation in their lesson plans to help each student truly understand the concept. However, students also learn in a warm and positive environment where they feel they are free to speak their mind with the teacher and other students.
        <br><br>
        My ultimate goal for my students is to help them figure out who they are in this big world and how they can participate in their community. In order for this to happen, I need to start in the classroom. Students need someone who they can lean on and a teacher is always there to support them and never give up on them.<br><br>
        An effective teacher is open-minded. A teacher is someone who has social cultural awareness so they are prepared to have any student in the classroom. A teacher is accepting and understanding. A teacher is patient and caring.

        <br><br>
        I believe all students are teachable. Students learn differently, but every student is capable of learning. It all depended on how students learn in and outside of the classroom. Hence, a teacher must meet every student’s individual needs.

        <h3>Personal Philosophy</h3>
        <p>My ultimate goal as a future teacher is to become a student’s role model whether that is academically or not. I want students to be able to come to me with any help they need. There is a belief that students usually only find a role model or remember a teacher who have had an effect on them and their future in high school or college. However, I believe that students can find those teachers at an earlier age. It just takes one teacher to make that difference in a student’s life, and I want to be that difference. I want to be able to inspire students to reach their full academic potential. In order to do this, I believe that it is important to use what I have learned from my own teachers as well as my own experiences from early field experiences in college.
        <br><br>I believe that every student is teachable. I understand that it can be difficult when a teacher is unable to see any progress from a certain individual or a group of students, but it is important to consider other options as to how to better help these students. Students learn differently, so it is important to consider that as a future teacher. I believe that in order for a student to succeed, I will need to learn from the student first to understand how they learn better. Hence, I believe it is important to understand that there is multiple learning styles/strategies. Students have different strengths. Students learn differently meaning that students are either visual learners, or learn better when teachers model/demonstrate what is expected from them, and some students learn better through a lecture method. Because of this, it is important to me to make sure to include different learning styles in order to make sure every student’s needs are being met. Differentiation is important, and it is something that I will implement in my future classroom.
	       <br><br>I believe it is important for students to start thinking critically at a young age. People believe that because students are younger, they might have little to no experience or lack the knowledge to think critically when it comes to real-world situations. However, I believe students deserve more credit than they get it. It is important for teachers to give students exposure to the real world, so students get a better understanding on what is happening around them and learn about problem-solving skills. For example, as a future teacher I will incorporate race and culture into the classroom so students can be exposed to other cultures and can become open-minded and are aware of situations that can happen outside the classroom. Thinking critically is important in this sense and in any other way related the the content-area as well; students should not be restricted to learning just in the classroom and specifically within the curriculum. In addition, students should be allowed to think critically because it brings curiosity into the classroom and it correlates to student’s interests. By doing this, it will better prepare them for the real world.
        <br><br>I believe it is important to include the arts in a student’s education. Two examples of this is music and art. It is important to incorporate arts and music in the curriculum because students have different strengths and are able to show their talent in a different way. I know a lot of teachers and schools in general who strictly focus only on the general school year curriculum; for example, they believe that math, history, science and literacy are the biggest factors in a student’s education and future. However, students have different passions and want to make the arts their profession. Because of this, it is important to acknowledge that some students have different strengths in different subjects. In addition, movement and exercise is important. Not only is it beneficial for a student’s health, but it also wakes students up during class and helps them become more engaged. I will take this into consideration because putting a strong emphasis on the broader curriculum should be the same emphasis that should be put on classes like art, music, and gym. Literacy, math, as well as other similar subjects are all necessary in a student’s future and actually play a huge role in classes like art. Hence, the broader curriculum should focus on the arts, but individual teachers should also include this in classrooms. For example, if I have students writing a short story, I will have them draw a picture along with it. Integrating lessons between school subjects is beneficial.
      	<br><br>Lastly, I believe in being progressive. The education system, the standards and strategies, technology, and student’s learning are all constantly changing. It can be extremely easy to avoid these changes and continue on with the traditional method one is use to, but it is important to branch out and learn about the progress because it can be beneficial to a student’s education. Traditionally, teachers focused mostly on lectures where everything was teacher-directed. However, over the past few years, teachers have tried to move on from that and I will continue to do the same. I believe that the classroom should be student-centered. It is important for students and teachers to work together in the classroom rather than have the teacher use direct transmission of knowledge. What I will focus on as a teacher is being able to learn from my students so I can be able to better help them succeed. This was I can learn how to teach them. In addition, I understand that students might learn better if they work together, so I will push for group based work. Similarly, I want students to understand the world, so I will apply real-world situations in the classroom. I want my classroom to be student-centered, and I will make sure this happens because they understand better of what they need and how it is delivered to them.</p>
