        <h3>Educational Philosophy</h3>
        <p>[What do you believe is the grander purpose of education in a society and community? You might answer that you believe education is a pivotal driver of change, advancement, and equality in society.<br><br>
        What, specifically, is the role of the teacher in the classroom? The role of a teacher is to use classroom instruction and presentations to help students learn and apply concepts in math, English, and science.
        <br><br>
        How do you believe students learn best? Students learn best in a warm and supportive environment where they feel the teacher truly cares about them and their success.
        <br><br>
        In general, what are your goals for your students? A teacher's primary goals are to help students figure out who they are and how they can be of service to their community.
        <br><br>
        What qualities do you believe an effective teacher should have? An effective teacher needs to have a basic sociocultural awareness of and acceptance of his own and others' cultural identities.<br><br>
        Do you believe that all students can learn? A good teacher certainly believes that each student can learn; the key is understanding what educational methods work best for each student and then catering instruction to each student's individual needs.
        <br><br>
        What do teachers owe their students? Teachers owe passion to their students—a passion for the subjects they teach, their instruction, and a desire to help students succeed.
        <br><br>
        What is your overall goal as a teacher? The overall goal for a teacher is multifaceted: to make learning fun and inspire students to find a love of learning; to create an organized classroom; to ensure that expectations are clear and grading is fair, and to incorporate the best available teaching strategies.
        <br><br>
        How do you create an inclusive learning environment? Students come from a variety of socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds and can vary greatly in cognitive ability and learning styles. A teacher needs to strive to incorporate instructional methods that consider all of the varied backgrounds and learning abilities of students.
        <br><br>
        How do you incorporate new techniques, activities, and types of learning into your teaching? A teacher should stay abreast of the latest educational research and incorporate best-practice methods into his instructional methods and strategies. (Best practice refers to existing practices that possess a high level of widely agreed effectiveness.)]</p></div>
