        <p>Hi, my name is Miss Chiquito. I was born and raised in a small neighborhood in Chicago, known as Pilsen. My parents migrated to the United States at a very young age. My mother was fifteen and my father traveled back and forth since he was fourteen. Through hardwork and determination, they received their citizenship. Without their support and love, I would not have been able to become the teacher I am today.</p>
        <p>I became interested in teaching my freshman year of high school when I became an Algebra tutor and when I started volunteering at my elementary school helping students with their homework in an after-school program. I worked hard throughout my high school career, so I can attend one of the best schools in the midwest. I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2019 with a Bachelors in Elementary Education and a Bilingual Endorsement, which allows me to teach in both Spanish and English. This school provided me many opportunities; for example, student teaching in a dual-language school, which helped me prepare lessons in both languages.</p>
        <p>I am currently a first year teacher in a second grade classroom at Learn Charter Network- South Chicago. Because of my experience and certification in my bilingual endorsement, I was assigned the English Language Learners classroom at South Chicago. By doing this, I have the opportunity to work closely with students who are currently learning and improving their English language everyday. My long-term goals are to go back to school to receive my masters in Educational Leadership. This will allow me to move up in my career and either become an instructional coach or be part of the administration team at an elementary school.</p>
